# Python - Object-relational mapping

In this project, I explored the concept of object-relational mapping and how it is used for database scripting. I gained familiarity with using MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to interact with databases, including querying, creating, editing, and deleting tables in MySQL.

## Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

### Get all states

**0-select_states.py**: This Python script uses MySQLdb to list all states in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`. Usage: `./0-select_states.py`. Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.

### Filter states

**1-filter_states.py**: This Python script uses MySQLdb to list all states with names starting with 'N' in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`. Usage: `./1-filter_states.py`. Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.

### Filter states by user input

**2-my_filter_states.py**: This Python script uses MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the `states` table of the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`. Usage: `./2-my_filter_states.py`. Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`. It uses string formatting to construct the SQL query.

### SQL Injection...

**3-my_safe_filter_states.py**: This Python script uses MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the `states` table of the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`. Usage: `./3-my_safe_filter_states.py`. Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`. This script is safe from SQL injections.

### Cities by states

**4-cities_by_state.py**: This Python script uses MySQLdb to list all cities from the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa`. Usage: `./4-cities_by_state.py`. Results are ordered by ascending `cities.id`.

### All cities by state

**5-filter_cities.py**: This Python script uses MySQLdb to list all cities of a given state in the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa`. Usage: `./5-filter_cities.py`. Results are sorted by ascending `cities.id`.

### First state model

**model_state.py**: This Python module defines a class `State` that inherits from SQLAlchemy Base and links to the MySQL table `states`.

### All states via SQLAlchemy

**7-model_state_fetch_all.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to list all `State` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`. Usage: `./7-model_state_fetch_all.py`. Results are sorted by ascending `states.id`.

### First state

**8-model_state_fetch_first.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to print the first `State` object from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`, ordered by `states.id`. Usage: `./8-model_state_fetch_first.py`. If the `states` table is empty, it prints "Nothing".

### Contains a

**9-model_state_filter_a.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to list all `State` objects that contain the letter 'a' in the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`. Usage: `./9-model_state_filter_a.py`. Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.

### Get a state

**10-model_state_my_get.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to print the id of the `State` object with a name matching the argument passed in the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`. Usage: `./10-model_state_my_get.py`. It displays the id of the matched `State`. If no match is found, it prints "Not found".

### Add a new state

**11-model_state_insert.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to add the `State` object "Louisiana" to the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`. Usage: `./11-model_state_insert.py`. It prints the id of the new `State` after creation.

### Update a state

**12-model_state_update_id_2.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to change the name of the `State` object with `id = 2` in the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa` to "New Mexico". Usage: `./12-model_state_update_id_2.py`.

### Delete states

**13-model_state_delete_a.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to delete all `State` objects with a name containing the letter 'a' from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`. Usage: `./13-model_state_delete_a.py`.

### Cities in state

**model_city.py**: This Python module defines a class `City` that inherits from SQLAlchemy Base and links to the MySQL table `cities`. It includes a class attribute `state_id` that is a foreign key to `states.id`.

**14-model_city_fetch_by_state.py**: This Python script uses SQLAlchemy to list all `City` objects in the database `hbtn_0e_14_usa`. Usage: `./14-model_city_fetch_by_state.py`. Results are sorted by ascending `cities.id`.
